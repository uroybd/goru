# goru / গরু

![goru](http://images.clipartpanda.com/cow-head-clipart-cow-head-only-small-eyes-hi.png)

A yet to be **cowsay** port in go.

You may already know **গরু/goru** means cow in Bangla. ;)


### Usage

Yet it is not much. You can ask it to say a single line with `-i` option like this:

```bash
$ goru -i Hello you! Munch Munch!
```

or simply run `goru` and type multiline dialouge. At the end type `Ctrl+]`
